		<p>As a Product Designer, I've been working with some great Iranian companies like Mapna Group, Digikala, Parsian Bank, Peyke Bartar, Mellat Bank, ADP and some great tech startups in past 6 years.
I've designed more than 10 products such as mobile apps, websites and service which have been used by millions of Iranians around the world.
I try to help building products by providing Product Strategy, UX Design, Visual Design, Motion and Interaction Design, User Research and Business Strategy.
Currently, I am the Product Design Manager of Dunro. I'm also helping various startups by Design Consulting.</p>
